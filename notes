                                       Third party api from weather underground
                                       works fine, however ajax it's not loading
                                       my city names local json file.
                                       javascript and thermostat works just fine.

      Heroku commit -->  created an app in Heroku ( thermostat1)
                         http://thermostat1.herokuapp.com

                         Javascript thermostat works fine.
                         Third party api from weather underground is not working
                         in Heroku.
                         Ajax /json files with city names aren't working in heroku
                         either.

                         My app was much better looking before heroku and sinatra
                         got involved!
